== Description ==
= What is Cactus Masonry? =

Cactus Masonry is a WordPress plugin designed to display a gallery of post and/or page thumbnails that can be filtered, sorted, and treated as hyperlinks.

In other words, a Cactus Masonry gallery will display a list of all matching posts which link back to their permalinks when clicked! This functionality would be perfect for an art or photo gallery where further information needs to be displayed on each item. Of course, you can choose where each picture links, whether back to the original image (at a size of your choosing), the original post, a Lightbox styled gallery, or nowhere at all.

As Cactus Masonry essentially searches your WordPress site for posts, you can specify which category (or categories) of post to display, and sort those posts by date, comment count, author, randomly, and more!

You can also specify the layout options for the pictures. By default, the pictures are positioned in a masonry styled layout, where the images are slotted into each other like irregular bricks in an old stone wall. However, you can force the plugin to restrict or constrain the heights or widths of the images to create a tidy and whitespace free gallery of images. Check out the [Cactus Masonry Home Page](http://cactuscomputers.com.au/masonry) for an example where the width has been constrained to 33.3%.

You may also specify how the images glow when the user’s mouse hovers overhead, whether the images have borders, and how much (if any) spacing should exist between each image.

The Cactus Masonry plugin provides a versatile WordPress plugin that allows you to display your posts by their thumbnail in a clean and visually pleasing format. 

= Can I See it In Action? =

Yes, go to the main page of [Cactus Masonry Website](http://cactuscomputers.com.au/masonry) to check it out! 

= Does it Cost Money? =

No, it’s all free to use. This is not one of those “free” plugins that require a payment before you can use any of its useful features. This is completely free – no watermarks, no ads, no nagging. Just one free plugin.

However, it did take a fair amount of time to make… so if you are feeling generous… feel free to [donate something](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=cactus%40cactuscomputers%2ecom%2eau&lc=AU&currency_code=AUD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted). But no pressure or anything :). 

= Can I Make a Feature Request? =

Yes. Contact us and we will consider any requests that are feasible and within the scope of the plugin. 

== Installation ==

Just click the Download link and Activate it!

Cactus Masonry is also available from the [Cactus Masonry Website](http://cactuscomputers.com.au/masonry) as a zip file for manual installation. 

If you choose to install Cactus Masonry manually it is important that you install the plugin in the correct folder.  While Cactus Masonry will work from any folder, changing the folder may affect your ability to receive new updates properly.

The correct folder for Cactus Masonry is a folder called masonry-post-gallery within your WordPress plugins folder.  By default the path should be wp-content/plugins/masonry-post-gallery/. 

= How Do I Use Cactus Masonry? =

Simple. If you can use a shortcode, then you can use Cactus Masonry.

A shortcode is a special piece of code you can insert into your WordPress posts and pages which links to an active plugin. If you insert [cactus-masonry] into one of your posts, you will see the Cactus Masonry gallery appear when you view (or preview) that post.

The shortcode can take a variety of parameters. For example, [cactus-masonry width=”33.33%”] will generate a gallery were each image is a third of the page wide. An example of this can be seen on the main page of the [Cactus Masonry Website](http://cactuscomputers.com.au/masonry). You can use as many or as few parameters in your shortcode as you want.

For a full list of Cactus Masonry’s shortcode parameters, visit the [Shortcode Parameters](http://cactuscomputers.com.au/masonry/gallery-options) page.

Alternately, visit the [Shortcode Generator](http://cactuscomputers.com.au/masonry/short-code-generator) to have your shortcode made for you!
